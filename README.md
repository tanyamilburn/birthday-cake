# Welcome

## to the Music Weather Selector

This is our first collaborative project for the U of U Coding Bootcamp. It's an
application that randomly selects a song for you based on the weather in a 
user-specified location, and a user-specified genre. The raw material for this 
logic is provided by the OpenWeather and MusixMatch APIs.

At a click the artist, album, and track information are displayed onscreen 
against a backdrop image representing the mood of the chosen locale.
